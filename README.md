# AMY-Synth-Projects
My experiments and projects using the AMY synthesis library

As I have been experimenting with mcu based synthesizer projects, I have been trying to get outside of the teensy audio library world.

I have been interested in ESP32, and have struggled to have success with mozzi audio library using I2S to an outboard dac, namely
the pcm5102 that I have become accustomed to using. I found the AMY synthesizer library, and have been working on getting it working
with the ESP32. Using the example ESP32 in the arduino IDE, I have been looking at the source code to figure out how it all works. 

As things go along, I will post new advancements as they come along, and I will do my best to make this repository organized enough to make sense
to those just starting out with this stuff, as I have had to learn alot over the last year or so to get to this point. 

Ill start at the beginning:
